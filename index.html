    <h3>App Events</h3>

    <p>
        The activate event fires only on macOS, but there are plenty of reasons why you might choose to have your application remain open on Windows or Linux, particularly if the application is running background processes that you want to continue even if the
        window is dismissed. Another possibility is that you have an application that can be hidden, or shown with a global shortcut, or from the tray or menu bar. We implement each of these in later chapters. <br> With these two additional events,
        weâ€™ve converted Fire Sale from a single-window application to one that supports multiple windows. This listing shows the code for the main process in its current form.
